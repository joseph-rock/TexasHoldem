# TexasHoldem

A Texas Hold'em simulation created in Java. The user can cycle through the various board states, dealing player and community cards. 
The table displayed in the upper-right will update during the "flop", "turn" and "river" to rank each player based on the best hand they possess.
The winning player(s) will be highlighted on the game board at the end of round.
